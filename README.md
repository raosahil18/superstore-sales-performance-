📈 In this project, I looked into the total sales, total profit, total volume, Sales per customer and many other metrics (Line chart, Pie chart etc) to gain insights into Superstore's Sales performance. By visualizing the data, I was able to identify key trends and patterns, allowing for more informed decision-making.<br>
